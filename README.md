## How did I implement VIPER?

Basically I have a protocol file for each scene in the app. This file defines the interaction between each layer as following:

* View - Presenter: protocols to notify changes and to inject information to the UI.
* Presenter - Interactor: protocols to request / receive information to / from the interactor.
* Presenter - Router: protocol to define the transitions between scenes.

Whith this protocols file is really easy to know how each layer notify / request / information to the other ones so we don't have any other way to communicate all the layers.

Another important point is because I'm using protocols it's really easy to define mocks views / presenters / interactors / routers for testing.
